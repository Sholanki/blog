Why?<br>The title of the book doesn't contain a period in it<br>and what is inside the quotes should to be the title of the book.<br>Rebel! Don't follow this English rule!</p><h3>Wasteful Words</h3><p>Write what you mean in as few words as possible.</p><p>Instead of writing<br><span class="bordered"><br>Tell me whether <b>or not</b> you like cheese.<br></span>,<br>just write<br><span class="bordered"><br>Tell me whether you like cheese.<br></span><br> We all know there's a possibility you don't like cheese.<br>That's why we're asking.</p><p>Instead of writing<br><span class="bordered"><br>The walls are two <b>different</b> colors.<br></span><br> write<br><span class="bordered"><br>The walls are two colors.<br></span><br> Nobody will think it's possible you meant<br>the walls are two colors that are blue and blue.</p><p>Instead of writing<br><span class="bordered"><br>The colors of apples, bananas, and grapes are<br>typically red, yellow, and green<b>, respectively</b>.<br></span><br> leave off<br><span class="bordered"><br>, respectively<br></span><br> Who in their right mind would change the order?</p><h3>Gender</h3><p>Using gender specific pronouns like &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; ruffles feathers<br>when there is no reason to specify a particular gender.<br>Many people try be politically correct by alternating between them.<br>English rules say you shouldn't use a generic word like &quot;them&quot; or &quot;they&quot;.<br>I say do it anyway. Instead of writing<br><span class="bordered"><br>When an employee is feeling angry,<br>tell <b>her</b> to take a walk around the building.<br></span>,<br>write<br><span class="bordered"><br>When an employee is feeling angry,<br>tell <b>them</b> to take a walk around the building.<br></span></p>
