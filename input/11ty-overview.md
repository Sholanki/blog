11ty is "a simple static style generator" (SSG).
It is targeted at building static "sites", not web "apps".
11ty is mostly written and maintained by Zach Leatherman.
It is implemented in JavaScript.

The rationale for the name "11ty" is in the 11ty docs under
[project naming](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-birthday/#project-naming).
It is related to how Zach Leatherman learned to count as a child.

The 11ty mascot is a possum attached to a helium balloon.
It was contributed by James Williamson in May 2018.

11ty is the most popular SSG that supports multiple template languages.

A lot of big names in the web community love 11ty, including
Mathias Bynens, Chris Coyier, Rob Dodson, Brian Leroux,
Addy Osmani, Dave Rupert, and Sara Soueidan.

See <https://www.11ty.dev/docs/testimonials/>.

11ty supports many markup languages including:

- HTML in .html files
- Markdown in .md files

11ty supports many templating languages including:

- [Embedded JavaScript (EJS)](https://ejs.co/) in `.ejs` files
- [Haml](http://haml.info/) in `.haml` files
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) in `.hbs` files
- JavaScript in `.11ty.js` files
- JavaScript Template Literals in `.jstl` files
- [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) from Shopify in `.liquid` files
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) in `.mustache` files
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) from Mozilla in `.njk` files
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) in `.pug` files

11ty does not currently support AsciiDoc.

An 11ty site can be built from source files that use
a combination of markup and templating languages.

An 11ty project can be configured to work with
existing content files and an existing directory structure.
It looks for template files in all project directories
and outputs `.html` files in the `_site` directory (by default)
with the same directory structure.
The convention to write files to the `_site` directory
was copied from Jekyll which inspired many parts of 11ty.

The build process requires Node, but sites generated by 11ty
do not require downloading any JavaScript code.
Serving only prebuilt pages provides great site performance.
JavaScript code can optionally be included for dynamic functionality.
