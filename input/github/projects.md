GitHub Projects provided a free alternative to project tracking solutions
such as Jira, Rally, and Trello.

Each project is associated with a single GitHub repository.
To create one:

1. Browse the repository.
1. Click the "Projects" tab.
1. Press the "Create a project" button.
1. Enter a project board name.
1. Optionally enter a project description.
1. Optionally select a project template such as "Basic kanban".
1. Press the "Create project" button.

If no project template is selected, columns can be added manually.

The "Basic kanban" project template provides three columns
named "To do", "In progress", and "Done"
with a few sample cards already in the "To do" column.
Close the card search results panel on the right
by clicking the "X" in the upper-right.

To delete a card, click the ellipsis in its upper-right
and select "Delete note".

To add a card in a column, click the "+" in the upper-right of the column.

To edit a card, click the ellipsis in the upper-right of the card
and select "Edit note". A dialog will open where changes can be made.

To move a card to a different column, drag it.
