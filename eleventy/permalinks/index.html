<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blog/assets/topic.css"><h2>Permalinks</h2><p>11ty permalinks specified in front matter change the path of the output files produced within the <code>_site</code> directory. They are useful when the source directory structure does not match the desired output directory structure.</p><p>When permalinks are specified, any links to those pages must be updated to match. Previously generated files under <code>_site</code> are not removed after permalinks are added or modified, so delete the <code>_site</code> directory and build again.</p><p>For example, the file <code>dogs.njk</code> would normally generate <code>_site/dogs/index.html</code>. To change this to <code>_site/animals/canines/index.html</code>, add the following front matter in <code>dogs.njk</code>:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">permalink</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'animals/canines/'</span></code></pre><p>The trailing slash is required. Including <code>index.html</code> is optional, but that is the file that is actually created.</p><p>An error is reported if multiple files target the same permalink path.</p><p>Permalink values can include variable references. For example:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">permalink</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'animals/{{species | slug}}'</span></code></pre><p>Quotes must surround values that include variable references. Using the <code>slug</code> filter encodes the value to ensure a valid URL. This filter is provided by 11ty, not Nunjucks.</p><p>Permalinks can be used in conjunction with pagination to change the paths to the files produced for each page. This is described in the next section.</p>
