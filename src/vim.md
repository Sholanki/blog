Many software developers know a little bit about Vim and
grudgingly use it when nothing else is available.
This article aims to quickly make you more productive when using Vim and perhaps
even convince you that there are reasons to prefer it over other editors.
Even if you don't adopt Vim as your primary editor,
you may wish to enable a Vim mode in your editor/IDE of choice.

The primary goal of this article is to make you more productive
without requiring any custom configuration or plugins.
This is not to suggest that you shouldn't customize Vim or use plugins,
just that it isn't necessary in order to be productive.
By learning only a few things,
you can make the experience of using Vim much nicer.
