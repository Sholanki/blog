The holy grail of web pages is to have:

- a header that is always visible
- a footer that is always visible
- a left nav in desktop view that scrolls independently from the main content
- a main content area that scrolls independently of the left nav
- have a header and footer that are always visible
  regardless of the amount of page content
- have a left nav and main area that scroll independently

This is implemented in {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/mvolkmann/holy-grail-html-css", "GitHub" %}.

It is hosted on {% aTargetBlank
"https://mvolkmann.github.io/holy-grail-html-css/", "GitHub Pages" %}.

Try making the width narrow or testing it from a phone
to see the hamburger menu in action.
