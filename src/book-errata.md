This is an errata for the book
"[Svelte and Sapper in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/svelte-and-sapper-in-action)".

### Chapter 1

p. 11 Change the second paragraph in section 1.1.3 to:

Svelte is implemented in TypeScript, but until July 21, 2020 it did not
support using TypeScript to define components out of the box.
This could be achieved with a little configuration and added tooling.
But now opting into the use of TypeScript is much easier.
See https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript for details.

### Index

p. 419 Swap and correct the page numbers for
"action function" and "actions in Storybook:

action function 128-129

actions in Storybook 227-231
