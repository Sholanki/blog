{% aTargetBlank "https://deno.land/", "Deno" %} is a
"secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript".
It has builtin support for TypeScript and is implemented in Rust.
It was created by Ryan Dahl who created
{% aTargetBlank "https://nodejs.org/", "Node.js" %}.

Deno is secure by default.
The environment, file system, and network
can only be accessed if explicitly enabled.

To get started and find documentation, see the
{% aTargetBlank "https://deno.land/manual", "Deno Manual" %}.
