Creating web applications that display text in
a variety of written languages is a common need.

One might think this is a solved problem and that simple solutions exist.
I have not found any that fit the bill, though, so I created web-translate,
an open source library that can be obtained via npm at {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-translate", "web-translate" %}.

The web-translate library provides
a set of JavaScript functions and a command that make
translating English to another language in web applications easy!
It is not specific to any framework and should work with
all the popular choices, including React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular.

The translations are performed as a build step,
so no cost for translation services is incurred during web application usage.

See my Object Computing (OCI) article {% aTargetBlank
"https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/september-2018-web-translate-javascript-library",
"Building Multilingual Web Apps with web-translate" %}.
