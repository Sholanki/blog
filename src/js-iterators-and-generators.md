ECMAScript 2015 (a.k.a. ES6) added many new features to the JavaScript language.
While most are easy to understand,
iterators and generators require a bit more effort.

This article provides a baseline for what you need to get started.
It assumes that you are familiar with several ES 2015 features,
including arrow functions, classes, destructuring, for-of loop, let/const,
and the spread operator.
If you need to brush up on these, check out Luke Hoban's overview at
{% aTargetBlank "https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features", "ES6 Features" %}.
There is also a video of a talk I gave on ES 2015 {% aTargetBlank
