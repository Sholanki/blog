Extensions for the Google Chrome browser can change
the look and feel of the GitHub web site.
For example, it is possible to make to look and operate
more like VS Code.
Recommended extensions to achieve this include:

1. **GitHub Dark Theme** - "A Dark theme for all of GitHub based on Atom One Dark"
1. **Octotree** - provides an "easy-to-navigate code tree, just like in IDEs"
1. **Wide GitHub** - "Change all Github repository and gist pages
   to be full width and dynamically sized."
1. **npmhub** - introspects dependencies in package.json and
   displays a link and description for each dependency
   below `package.json` content

To download and install these, browse <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/>.

The end result is that browsing a GitHub repo can look like the following:
