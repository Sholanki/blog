Emmet is an editor plugin for quickly entering HTML, XML, and CSS.
It also supports many "actions" that operate on HTML and XML elements.
The most commonly used action is to expand an abbreviation or snippet.

Emmet was created by Sergey Chikuyonok. The original name was "Zen Coding."

Emmet is available for many editors including Atom, Eclipse, Emacs, Notepad++,
Sublime, Vim, Visual Studio (VS) Code, and WebStorm.
However, some implementations do not support
all the defined snippets and actions.

Emmet is not just a simple snippet manager.
It parses entered text to extract meaning.
These kinds of snippets are referred to as "dynamic snippets."
