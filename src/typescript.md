In his book, JavaScript: The Good Parts, Douglas Crockford states,
"In JavaScript, there is a beautiful, elegant, highly expressive language
that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders."

The combination of features added to JavaScript in ES2015 (ES6) and beyond,
plus the use of ESLint, makes JavaScript quite a nice language.

TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language.
Therefore, it contains the same beautiful features and blunders
that are present in JavaScript.
But it also adds many features,
some of which are beautiful and some not so much.

This article presents the most valuable parts of the TypeScript language.
At the end, it lists features that most developers should avoid.
